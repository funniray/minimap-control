#Minimap Control
This plugin allows players to control how minimaps mods work per world on Spigot or Sponge based servers.

## Current Support:
- Journeymap
- XaerosMinimap

Journeymap config options are configurable either in game with journeymap, or via the config file  
Xaero's minimap is only configurable via the config file.

#### JM Note: Some worlds might not appear in journeymap's in game config editor. This is a journeymap limit. Per-world configs are applied regardless.
#### Xaeros Note: Players connecting with version Xaero's Minimap version 23.7.0 or below will be kicked from the server. These versions did not respect the config packet. PRs to change this behavior are welcome.
